- AdipoQ_Analyzer_-…-SNAPSHOT.jar (Download latest release [here](https://github.com/hansenjn/AdipoQ_Analyzer/releases)): An ImageJ plugin to quantify objects (i.e., adipocytes, lipid droplets, nuclei) from a segmented image or a multi-channel image featuring at least one segmented chanenl.
- R markdown templates for post-hoc analysis: Will be available here soon.

Both tools are optimized for studying adipocytes in stained tissue or *in vitro* after immunofluorescent labeling.
